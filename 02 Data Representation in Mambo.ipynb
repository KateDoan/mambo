    "# 02 Data Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "One advantage of using Mambo to represent biological networks is its ability to represent heterogeneous biological network. It is important to understand how these networks are represented: there are two types of data in multimodal networks, modes and links. \n",

    "In this section, we detail what **modes** and **links** are and how they are represented. \n",

    "# Nodes vs. Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "Nodes represent biological entities, like genes, chemicals, or diseases. Each node belongs to a node type, or a set of nodes of the same biological type, referred to as a **mode**. In Mambo, nodes are stored in tables, with one table per mode. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of mode tables in Mambo. (1) First, there is a **full mode table**, which maps a unique Mambo node ID to each node and also lists which dataset the node comes from. (2) Second, there are additional **mode tables, one for each dataset**, which map the unique Mambo node ID to the name of the node in the dataset from which it originates.\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide below an example for these two types of mode tables. The first is the full mode table for genes. The gene mode table is constructed from two databases: [GeneMANIA](http://genemania.org) and [HUGO](https://www.genenames.org). The first column in the table corresponds to the unique Mambo node ID and the second column lists the IDs of the databases where the node is found. \n",

    "# Controlled Vocabularies a.k.a. Mapping Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Controlled vocabularies map a given biological entity to different naming schemes. Mambo uses controlled vocabularies to solve a very pressing challenge in biomedical data related to the use of multiple distinct names to refer to the same entity. For example, gene ``A1BG`` is referred to as ``ENSG00000121410`` in the [ENSEMBL database](https://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Summary?g=ENSG00000121410;r=19:58345178-58353499), but as ``HGNC:5`` in the [HUGO database](https://www.genenames.org/cgi-bin/gene_symbol_report?hgnc_id=HGNC:5). That gene also has a protein `` P04217`` in the [UniProtKB database](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P04217). The challenge is even more apparent in other types of biological entities, such as diseases, for example ``Dressler's syndrome`` is referred to as ``DOID:10507`` in [Disease Ontology](http://disease-ontology.org/), but as ``UMLS_CUI:C0152107`` in the [UMLS database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/508890). Furthermore, this syndrome also has an alternative name, ``Postmyocardial infarction syndrome``.\n",
    "\n",
    "When data is collected from multiple databases, each database often uses its own naming scheme. However, we only want truly distinct entities to be distinct in the network and do not want the same entity to appear in the network multiple times. To tackle this issue, Mambo provides mapping capabilities in the form of **mapping dictionaries**. Given a mapping between entities in a given mode, function `create_mapping_table()` in `utils/create_mapping_table.py` creates a dictionary for these. If using mapping dictionaries, you should use `create_mapped_mode_table()`, located in `utils/create_mapped_mode_table.py` in order to create mode tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following table shows a mapping table between two naming schemes for proteins, ENSEMBL Protein IDs and UniprotKB IDs. For example, ENSP00000349259 and Q01082 correspond to the same protein, which is represented using Mambo ID 0 in the multimodal network.\n",
